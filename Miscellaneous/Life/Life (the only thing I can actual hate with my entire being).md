Why live?

	Cuz of mom? Yes and No
	
		Yes, because I believe mom might be unhappy without me? Why
			Because she said so? When?
				The last time when I said I wanted to kms to her. Why did I say that?
					Honestly can't even remember why I said it. But I prob fought with her about something? What might that be?
					
						She told me to do something and I knew where it would lead me to due to my princples and knew she wouldn't like it and I told her that without sheding light into any of my principles and she still told me do it. Canada.
