| Definition                  | A **React framework** that extends React with additional features.                                                                              | A **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces.         |
| Rendering                   | Supports **SSR (Server-Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation), ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), and CSR (Client-Side Rendering).** | Only supports **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** by default.      |
| SEO                         | ‚úÖ **Great for SEO** (pre-rendered pages load faster)                                                                                            | ‚ùå **Not SEO-friendly** by default (content loads dynamically)  |
| Routing                     | ‚úÖ **File-based routing** (automatic page generation)                                                                                            | ‚ùå **Manual routing** with React Router                         |
| Performance                 | ‚úÖ **Automatic code splitting & optimization**                                                                                                   | ‚ùå Requires **manual optimizations**                            |
| Image Optimization          | ‚úÖ Built-in `next/image` for lazy loading & resizing                                                                                             | ‚ùå Needs third-party libraries                                  |
| API Handling                | ‚úÖ Built-in API routes (`/pages/api/`)                                                                                                           | ‚ùå Needs a separate backend                                     |
| Static & Dynamic Pages      | ‚úÖ Supports **SSG, ISR** for fast static content                                                                                                 | ‚ùå No built-in static generation                                |
| Middleware & Authentication | ‚úÖ Supports **middleware & built-in authentication** (e.g., NextAuth.js)                                                                         | ‚ùå Needs external solutions for authentication                  |
| Deployment                  | ‚úÖ Optimized for **Vercel**, but works with other platforms                                                                                      | ‚ùå Needs **manual setup** for hosting                           |
| Use Case                    | Best for **SEO-focused, high-performance, full-stack apps**                                                                                     | Best for **SPAs (Single Page Applications) and UI components** |
